SQL Exploration of Socioeconomic, Education, and Crime Data

This project analyzes socioeconomic data from Chicago's 77 community areas to identify patterns, disparities, and relationships between various socioeconomic indicators. SQL is used for data querying, Python for analysis and visualization, Python libraries used include pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and skit-learn.


I hope to use this project as a way to practice understanding the world around me through data, while learning new skills essential in data science such as SQL data querying, data visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and dashboard creation.
